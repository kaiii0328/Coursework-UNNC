function [maze, position, nodes] = move2(maze, position, nodes, difficulty)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132 Program Description
%	This function his function takes a maze and generates one new point along its current path. This function is
%   recursively called within the main function until there are zero nodes. This function first calls validateMove to
%   get a list of possible directions the function can go. If there are 0 possible directions and the current position
%   is a node, the node is removed and the current position is set to the last node on the list. If there are 0 possible
%   directions and the current position is not a node, the current position is set to the last node on the list. If
%   there are 1, 2, 3, or 4 possible directions, the function does a couple of things. It first finds a random direction
%   using the weighting described in the movement section of this README. It then finds the position of the previous
%   position (whatever point was created just before this one). It then calls the checkNodes function. If it returns
%   true, then add the current point to the node list. Regardless, the currentPoint is set equal to the futurePoint and
%   that point in the maze is set to 1. maze, pos, and nodes are all returned in order to make this function easy to be
%   called recursively.
